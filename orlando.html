            <p>Orlando, located in central Florida, is one of the most popular travel destinations in the world. Known for its incredible theme parks, entertainment options, and welcoming atmosphere, the city offers endless excitement for families, couples, and adventure seekers alike.</p>

  <p>Walt Disney World Resort and Universal Orlando Resort are the city’s biggest attractions, each offering immersive worlds filled with rides, shows, and unforgettable experiences. Beyond the parks, SeaWorld Orlando and LEGOLAND Florida add even more variety for visitors of all ages.</p>

  <p>Orlando isn’t just about theme parks—it’s also a great place to relax and explore. Visitors can enjoy shopping and dining at ICON Park, stroll through the beautiful Harry P. Leu Gardens, or experience the city’s growing arts and food scenes in neighborhoods like Winter Park and Thornton Park.</p>

  <p><strong>Travel tip:</strong> To make the most of your visit, plan park days early in the week and arrive when the gates open. The best time to visit is from January to April, when the weather is mild and the crowds are smaller.</p>
