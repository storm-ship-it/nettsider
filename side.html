            <p>Miami is one of Florida’s most exciting and colorful destinations, blending tropical beauty with a lively urban atmosphere. Known for its stunning beaches, diverse culture, and vibrant nightlife, the city attracts visitors from all over the world.</p>

  <p>South Beach is Miami’s iconic hotspot, famous for its Art Deco architecture, white sand, and turquoise water. The area comes alive day and night with beachgoers, trendy restaurants, and lively bars. Beyond the beach, neighborhoods like Little Havana and Wynwood offer a taste of Miami’s cultural side, with Cuban coffee, street art, and live music around every corner.</p>

  <p>Visitors can explore Biscayne Bay by boat, stroll along Ocean Drive, or relax under the palms at Bayfront Park. For a more natural escape, the nearby Everglades provide opportunities for airboat rides and wildlife spotting just a short drive away.</p>

  <p><strong>Travel tip:</strong> Visit Miami between November and April for the best weather and fewer rain showers, perfect for outdoor adventures and beach days.</p>
