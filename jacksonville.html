  <p>Jacksonville, located in northeast Florida, is a city that combines urban energy with natural beauty. As the largest city by area in the continental United States, it offers miles of beaches, scenic river views, and a vibrant arts and dining scene.</p>

  <p>The city’s coastline stretches for more than 20 miles, with popular spots like Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, and Atlantic Beach providing perfect places to swim, surf, or simply relax by the ocean. The nearby St. Johns River adds another layer of charm, offering boating, kayaking, and waterfront dining opportunities.</p>

  <p>Downtown Jacksonville features modern attractions such as the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Jacksonville Symphony, while the historic Riverside and Avondale districts are known for their tree-lined streets, local boutiques, and cozy cafés. Sports fans can catch a Jacksonville Jaguars game or explore TIAA Bank Field along the riverfront.</p>

  <p><strong>Travel tip:</strong> Jacksonville is ideal for outdoor enthusiasts. Plan your visit in spring or fall for pleasant weather and local festivals celebrating the city’s culture and coastal lifestyle.</p>
